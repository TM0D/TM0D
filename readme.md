Hi!

I'm Saera and I'm a casual Beat Saber player, so not much to see here. I'm not terribly good but I have fun playing and occasionally making modcharts.

I am usually found doing some type of programming, although it could be anything really. I mostly use programming to solve problems and make things better.        

I'm also a <a class="bio" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CubeCommunity" target="_blank" >Cube Community</a> editor, so that's fun I guess. I manage the Noodle Map Monday series, where we showcase the fun and cool stuff the community has put together with various mods. You can find all of the videos in one super convenient playlist on the channel <a class="bio" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwx5EB8PdMNeuygkTEeowY-bXj5F-2SCU" target="_blank">here</a>. If you just want to play the maps yourself, you can find the link to each map in the video description, or you can find a playlist with every map <a class="bio" href="https://beatsaver.com/playlists/4197" target="_blank">here</a>. This playlist is usually updated within a couple hours of a video coming out.

You can find maps im involved with and other socials down below. You can contact me on Twitter at <a class="bio" href="https://twitter.com/Saeraphinx" target="_blank">@Saeraphinx</a> or on Discord at <a class="bio" href="https://discord.com/users/213074932458979330" target="_blank">Saeraphinx#4533</a>.

this line is for a test config.
