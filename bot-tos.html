          Luma does not have very many distict rules, as it is a private bot. However, there are some things that have the ability to get your ID banned from the bot. These include:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Abusing the bot in any way (e.g. spamming the FAQ reader)</li>
            <li>Attempting to exploit the bot</li>
            <li>Attempting to use the bot to break Discord's TOS</li>
            <li>Attempting to use the bot to break the server's rules</li>
          </ul>
        <p class="tos text">
          The gist of the rules is: don't be a jerk, don't try to break things, and don't try to get around the rules/safeguards put in place. If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact me using the links on my homepage or at <a class="bio" href="https://discord.com/users/213074932458979330" target="_blank">Saeraphinx</a> on Discord.
